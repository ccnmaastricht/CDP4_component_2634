## Title
Brain-constrained deep learning modules for visuo-motor integration tasks

## Description
This Component builds on the CDP4 visuo-motor integration neural network model replacing hand-crafted modules with deep learning networks in order to achieve more robust functionality. Learning of specific cognitive functions, including calculation of saliency, attention shifts and target selection, will be based on large training data sets with natural images as input and grasping or eye movement data as output. The computational properties emerging from learned connectivity patterns within and between hidden layers solving specific visuo-motor tasks will be used to derive new insights in computational mechanisms that can be tested by subsequent neuroscientific research.
